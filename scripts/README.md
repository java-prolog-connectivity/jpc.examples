This folder contains scripts for the generation of Logtalk documentation and diagrams.
Before using them you should specify your preferred Logtalk binary by means of the logtalk_backend_select script (available as part of Logtalk).

Afterwards, use the make.sh script to generate the documentation and diagrams in the <PROJECT_ROOT>/docs/logtalkdocs directory.
